/// The [TargetPlatform] that matches the platform on which the framework is

///
/// This is the default value of [ThemeData.platform] (hence the name). Widgets
/// from the material library should use [Theme.of] to determine the current
/// platform for styling purposes, rather than using [defaultTargetPlatform].
/// However, if there is widget behavior that depends on the actual underlying
/// platform, then depending on [defaultTargetPlatform] makes sense.
/// [dart.io.Platform.environment] should be used directly only when it's
/// critical to actually know the current platform, without any overrides
/// possible (for example, when a system API is about to be called).
///
/// In a test environment, the platform returned is [TargetPlatform.android]
/// regardless of the host platform. (Android was chosen because the tests were
/// originally written assuming Android-like behavior, and we added platform
/// adaptations for iOS later). Tests can check iOS behavior by using the
/// platform override APIs (such as [ThemeData.platform] in the material
/// library) or by setting [debugDefaultTargetPlatformOverride].
//
// When adding support for a new platform (e.g. Windows Phone, macOS), first
// create a new value on the [TargetPlatform] enum, then add a rule for
// selecting that platform here.
//
// It would be incorrect to make a platform that isn't supported by
// [TargetPlatform] default to the behavior of another platform, because doing
// that would mean we'd be stuck with that platform forever emulating the other,
// and we'd never be able to introduce dedicated behavior for that platform
// (since doing so would be a big breaking change).

/// (such as [ThemeData.platform] in the material library) instead.
///
/// Setting [debugDefaultTargetPlatformOverride] (as opposed to, say,
/// [ThemeData.platform]) will cause unexpected and undesirable effects. For
/// example, setting this to [TargetPlatform.iOS] when the application is
/// running on Android will cause the TalkBack accessibility tool on Android to
/// be confused because it would be receiving data intended for iOS VoiceOver.
/// Similarly, setting it to [TargetPlatform.android] while on iOS will cause
/// certainly widgets to work assuming the presence of a system-wide back
/// button, which will make those widgets unusable since iOS has no such button.
