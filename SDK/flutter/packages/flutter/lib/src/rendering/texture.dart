/// A rectangle upon which a backend texture is mapped.
///
/// Backend textures are images that can be applied (mapped) to an area of the
/// Flutter view. They are created, managed, and updated using a
/// platform-specific texture registry. This is typically done by a plugin
/// that integrates with host platform video player, camera, or OpenGL APIs,
/// or similar image sources.
///
/// A texture box refers to its backend texture using an integer ID. Texture
/// IDs are obtained from the texture registry and are scoped to the Flutter
/// view. Texture IDs may be reused after deregistration, at the discretion
/// of the registry. The use of texture IDs currently unknown to the registry
/// will silently result in a blank rectangle.
///
/// Texture boxes are repainted autonomously as dictated by the backend (e.g. on
/// arrival of a video frame). Such repainting generally does not involve
/// executing Dart code.
///
/// The size of the rectangle is determined by the parent, and the texture is
/// automatically scaled to fit.
///
